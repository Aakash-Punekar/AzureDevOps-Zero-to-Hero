## What is Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is a suite of services using which you can implement end-to-end DevOps in your organization. It includes services such as Azure Repos, Boards, Wiki, Build and Release pipelines, Test plans, Artifacts and so on.

## Type of Hosting Options
You can work in the cloud using **Azure DevOps Services** or on-premises using **Azure DevOps Server**.
Organizations that want complete control over their data would mostly prefer to use **Azure DevOps Server**.
We will use the cloud offering **Azure DevOps Services** throughout our course.

## Pricing
In the basic plan, you will get the first 5 users free of cost with all the services within certain limits except the Azure test plan, for which you need a Basic+Test plan subscription/
